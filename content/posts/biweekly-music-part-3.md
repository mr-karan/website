Since the past one week, I'm having troubles in connecting to Spotify from India and my #1 source for discovering music is gone.<i class="em em-disappointed"></i>
I've started using `Saavn` but it has crappy recommendations and too much of "Bollywoody"/crap shit thrown all over. Also, it requires location access to suggest new
music. LOL is this a joke or what? Like seriously, can't think of a single reason why a ML algo would require my location to suggest me music.

Anyway, this week's recommendation might be a bit more "Desi" as I've discovered some real good bands from our country and our beloved neighbours(ofcourse!)
